We know that eating disorders look different across persons, but we don’t know why or how that impacts treatment. We also know that only half of people who access evidence-based treatment will recover. Thus, my program of research aims to understand the mechanisms that influence eating disorder psychopathology by considering individual variability, time, and context. I think that an idiographic framework, coupled with methods that leverage time-intensive data in naturalistic settings are best equipped to examine how eating disorders unfold in real time in the real world. I hope that this focus will inform personalized treatment to improve clinical outcomes, and ultimately facilitate recovery. I also have a line of research that specifically focuses on ED and body image experiences of queer and trans individuals. Most of my questions can be distilled to:\nWhy do eating disorders persist?\nAt what timescale do symptoms change?\nHow do we make sense of the heterogeneity?\nHow can we use this information to improve treatment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentative Publications\n\nCusack, C.

I am passionate about initiatives that influence public policy, such as increasing access to mental health care, and creating safer spaces within academia for students with marginalized identities. As a White, currently able-bodied person, I recognize that these identities place me at a social location of privilege, especially within academia. As such, I am committed to leveraging my position of power to support others with systematically marginalized identities, disseminate research to broad audiences, and make my research transparent within academic spheres.\nMentorship\nI recognize that one of the most effective ways to promote diverse scholarship is through culturally responsive mentorship. I take an individualized approach to mentorship to support trainees’ unique goals. When we build on our strengths and improve upon our gaps in knowledge, we are better equipped to meaningfully contribute to team science. To this end, I have mentored undergraduate students on professional and academic development. This has included mentorship on undergraduate theses, writing letters of recommendation, and making myself available for mock interviews. I have also designed and implemented a course-based undergraduate research experience that provides research-based mentorship.
