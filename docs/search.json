By understanding the timescale at which symptoms\nrelate within persons, I hope that my program of research will inform\npersonalized treatment. I also have a line of research that specifically\nfocuses on ED and body image experiences of queer and trans individuals.\nMost of my questions can be distilled to:\n-Why do eating disorders persist?\n-How do we make sense of the heterogeneity?\n-How can we use this information to improve treatment?\n\n\n \n\n\nRepresentative\nPublications\n\nLevinson, C.

I am\npassionate about initiatives that influence public policy, such as\nincreasing access to mental health care, and creating safer spaces\nwithin academia for students with marginalized identities. As an\nemerging scientist, I believe it is my responsibility to make Clinical\nScience an inclusive environment. Many of my identities are privileged.\nMy whiteness affords me safety within and outside of academic spaces and\ncomes with generational wealth. I live in an able-body, received higher\neducation, and my immediate family also has advanced degrees. I identify\nmy gender as cis/agender femme, as gender is not salient to me, and I\nconsider my sexual orientation queer. I do not experience gender\ndysphoria, and I often express my gender femme-of-center. Though this\nmeans I am often misread by others, it also means that people do not\nmark me as deviating from binary gender norms.\nMentorship\nI recognize that one of the most effective ways to promote diverse\nscholarship is through mentoring those with less privileged\npositionalities than me. To this end, I have mentored undergraduate\nstudents on professional and academic development. This has included\nmentorship on undergraduate theses, writing letters of recommendation,\nand making myself available for mock interviews.\nCommittees\nAcademy for Eating Disorders, 2020 - 2023\nMembership Recruitment and Retention Committee (MRRC), Diversity,\nEquity, and Inclusion subcommittee\nKentucky State Council for Eating Disorders, 2021 -\npresent Accessibility, Affordability, and Accountability Committee\nProgramming\nI’ve created 30-45 minute interactive workshops for college students\non a range of mental health topics. \n\n\n\n",
