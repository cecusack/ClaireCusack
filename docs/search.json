We know that eating disorders look different across persons, but we don’t know why or how that impacts treatment. We also know that only half of people who access evidence-based treatment will recover. Thus, my program of research aims to understand the maintenance mechanisms of eating disorder psychopathology by considering individual variability, time, and context. I think that an idiographic framework, coupled with methods that leverage time-intensive data in naturalistic settings are best equipped to examine how eating disorders unfold in real time in the real world. I hope that this focus will inform personalized treatment to improve clinical outcomes, and ultimately facilitate recovery. I also have a line of research that specifically focuses on ED and body image experiences of queer and trans individuals. Most of my questions can be distilled to:\nWhy do eating disorders persist?\nAt what timescale do symptoms change?\nHow do we make sense of the heterogeneity?\nHow can we use this information to improve treatment?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRepresentative Publications\n\nCusack, C.

I am passionate about initiatives that influence public policy, such as increasing access to mental health care, and creating safer spaces within academia for students with marginalized identities. As an emerging scientist, I believe it is my responsibility to make Clinical Science an inclusive environment. Many of my identities are privileged. My whiteness affords me safety within and outside of academic spaces and comes with generational wealth. I live in an able-body, received higher education, and my immediate family also has advanced degrees. I identify my gender as cis/agender femme, as gender is not salient to me, and I consider my sexual orientation queer. I do not experience gender dysphoria, and I often express my gender femme-of-center. Though this means I am often misread by others, it also means that people do not mark me as deviating from binary gender norms.\nMentorship\nI recognize that one of the most effective ways to promote diverse scholarship is through mentoring those with less privileged positionalities than me. To this end, I have mentored undergraduate students on professional and academic development. This has included mentorship on undergraduate theses, writing letters of recommendation, and making myself available for mock interviews. I have also designed and implemented a course-based undergraduate research experience that provides research-based mentorship.
