Professional Website. I used Dr. Maria Tackett's [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYf5HqU1pI4) presented at R Ladies Baltimore to create this site. Packages used include `{blogdown}`, `{distill}`, and `{postcards}`.

For CV and posters, I've created a folder in google drive where I've saved pdf versions. I linked these urls to images so that viewers can view my CV or enlarge posters.
