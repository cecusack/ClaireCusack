## Bio

Hello! My name is Claire (they/she pronouns), and I am a doctoral student in Clinical Psychology at the University of Louisville under the mentorship of Dr. Cheri Levinson. I am funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program. I am broadly interested in exploring maintenance symptoms of eating disorders and comorbidities and aim for my program of research to integrate theoretical and empirical research. I am particularly interested in applying idiographic statistical methods to understand to understand the heterogeneity of eating disorder symptoms, with the ultimate goal of informing tailored treatments. In my free time, I enjoy trail running, reading novels, and playing board games.
