My research is centered on understanding trajectories eating disorder relapse, recovery, and maintenance within individuals. We know that eating disorders look different across persons, but we don't know why or how that impacts treatment. We also know that only half of people who access evidence-based treatment will recover. Thus, my program of research aims to understand the mechanisms that influence eating disorder psychopathology by considering individual variability, time, and context. I think that an idiographic framework, coupled with methods that leverage time-intensive data in naturalistic settings are best equipped to examine how eating disorders unfold in real time in the real world. I hope that this focus will inform personalized treatment to improve clinical outcomes, and ultimately facilitate recovery. I also have a line of research that specifically focuses on ED and body image experiences of queer and trans individuals. Most of my questions can be distilled to:  

- Why do eating disorders persist?  
- At what timescale do symptoms change?    
- How do we make sense of the heterogeneity?   
- How can we use this information to improve treatment?
