 Science is often inaccessible. Paywalls, academic jargon, and racist, classist elitism make consuming data difficult. To have broad impacts, it is necessary to reach a *broad* audience, which means disseminating information beyond peer-reviewed journals and academic conferences. To that end, I've started writing blog posts, creating fun shiny apps, and social media graphics about Psychology.
