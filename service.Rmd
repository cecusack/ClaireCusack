A central component of my academic identity centers service. I am passionate about initiatives that influence public policy, such as increasing access to mental health care, and creating safer spaces within academia for students with marginalized identities. As a White, currently able-bodied person, I recognize that these identities place me at a social location of privilege, especially within academia. As such, I am committed to leveraging my position of power to support others with systematically marginalized identities, disseminate research to broad audiences, and make my research transparent within academic spheres.

# Mentorship
I recognize that one of the most effective ways to promote diverse scholarship is through culturally responsive mentorship. I take an individualized approach to mentorship to support trainees' unique goals. When we build on our strengths and improve upon our gaps in knowledge, we are better equipped to meaningfully contribute to team science. To this end, I have mentored undergraduate students on professional and academic development. This has included mentorship on undergraduate theses, writing letters of recommendation, and making myself available for mock interviews. I have also designed and implemented a course-based undergraduate research experience that provides research-based mentorship.
